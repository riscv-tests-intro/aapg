Automated Assembly Program Generator
===================================
Automated Assembly Program Generator (``aapg``) is a tool 
that is intended to generate random RISC-V programs
to test RISC-V cores.

Quick Install
-------------
There are two ways to get started with aapg. The easiest one is via pip.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install aapg

Next, Setup a working directory and build environment,

.. code-block:: bash
    
    aapg setup  

This creates the folders for the outputs of each step that is compiling the assembly to machine code, dumping a disassemly and then running the simulator on spike (riscv-isa-sim). It also creates a sample ``config.yaml`` to configure each ``aapg`` run.

Once the previous steps have been completed, we can run ``aapg``
using the following command.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    aapg gen 

By default, ``aapg`` generates 64 bit programs. To generate 32 bit programs, you have to run,

.. code-block:: bash

    aapg gen --arch rv32

You should find your random program generated in
``work/asm/out_config_00000.S`` in your current directory. By default,
``aapg`` expects the configuration file to be ``config.yaml``
and the output file will be ``work/asm/out_config_00000.S`` in the directory
that ``aapg`` was run in. To build the programs and run them on Spike,

.. code-block:: bash

    make

Alternatively for compiling using the 32-bit toolchain, you can type,

.. code-block:: bash

    make XLEN=32

You can check the logfiles in the ``log`` directory and the disassembled code in ``objdump`` directory.

Example config.yamls with all options can be found in the ```test/ci_cd_templates``` directory. 

To convert configuration files from older versions of aapg (either ``.ini`` or ``.yaml``) to newer versions, use the ``convert`` option,  

.. code-block:: bash

    aapg convert --file=/path/to/oldconfig

Developer Install
-----------------
The other way to install it is by using Git. This allows you to stay updated with the latest developments
and is required when you want to develop ``aapg`` further and push changes. You can follow these steps,

.. code-block:: bash
    
    git clone https://gitlab.com/shaktiproject/tools/aapg
    cd aapg
    python3 setup.py install

This will install aapg on your path.
